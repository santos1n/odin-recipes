    <h3>
      A good, old fashioned tapa and egg duo is a classic combination any
      Filipino would enjoy. Tender beef in a sweet and savory marinade, with
      creamy eggs to boot, is always a meal to look forward to, and breakfast
      lovers, especially, know this all too well. After all, who can resist the
      mouthwatering aroma that wafts through the kitchen whenever the classic
      tapsilog is the first meal of the day? That said, though a timeless
      favorite, plain old tapsilog may not sound like the most exciting dish in
      the world. So if you’re craving something new, why not try this tapa and
      egg fried rice?
